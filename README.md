üîç Project Overview
As a Data Analyst, this project served as a hands-on experience in building a dynamic Power BI HR dashboard. My primary goal was to provide transparent and insightful views into Palmoria Group's employee data, highlighting key trends and patterns in gender distribution, performance ratings, salary structures, minimum wage compliance, and bonus payouts. This system aims to enable HR and leadership to make more informed and equitable decisions, fostering data-driven improvements in employee welfare and organizational efficiency.

üìä Dataset Insights
My analysis was conducted on two proprietary datasets provided by Palmoria Group:
 * Palmoria Group emp-data.csv: This is the primary employee dataset containing 946 unique employee records across various key attributes.
* Highlights of the Data Fields:
* Name, Gender, Department, Salary, Location, Rating
* Data Cleaning and Transformation Applied:
* Missing Gender values replaced with 'Undisclosed'.
* 'N/A' gender values replaced with 'Undisclosed'.
* Rows with missing Salary or Department removed.
* Department values 'NULL' removed.
* Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx - Bonus Rules.csv: This dataset outlines the department-specific bonus percentages based on performance ratings.
* Highlights of the Data Fields:
* Department, Very Poor, Poor, Average, Good, Very Good (bonus percentages for each rating).
* Data Transformation Applied:
* Unpivoted the performance rating columns (Very Poor to Very Good) into a single 'Rating' column and a 'Bonus_Percentage' column, transforming the data from a wide to a long format.

üìã Core Analytical Questions & Approaches
To derive meaningful insights, I tackled a series of business-centric HR questions, employing various Power BI functionalities and DAX logic:
| Analytical Question | Power BI/DAX Approach & Logic Used |
|---|---|
| ‚Ä¢ How to calculate the overall gender distribution in the organization. | DAX Measure: COUNTROWS(Table) / CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Table), ALL(Table)) for overall percentage. COUNTROWS(FILTER(Table, Table[Gender] = "Female")) for specific gender count. |
| ‚Ä¢ How to calculate gender distribution by region. | DAX Measure with CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Table), ALLEXCEPT(Table, Table[Location])) for regional total, and COUNTROWS(FILTER(Table, Table[Gender] = "Female" && Table[Location] = "Abuja")) for specific gender/region count. |
| ‚Ä¢ How to calculate gender distribution by department. | DAX Measure with CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Table), ALLEXCEPT(Table, Table[Department])) for department total, and COUNTROWS(FILTER(Table, Table[Gender] = "Male" && Table[Department] = "Sales")) for specific gender/department count. |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the total number of employees after cleaning? | DAX Measure: COUNTROWS(FILTER('Employee Table', NOT(ISBLANK('Employee Table'[Salary])) && 'Employee Table'[Department] <> "NULL")) |
| ‚Ä¢ How many unique departments exist? | DAX Measure: DISTINCTCOUNT('Employee Table'[Department]) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the distribution of performance ratings across the organization? | DAX Visual: Use 'Rating' column on an axis and 'Count of Employees' (simple COUNTROWS measure) as values. |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the average salary by department? | DAX Measure: AVERAGE('Employee Table'[Salary]) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the total salary budget for the company? | DAX Measure: SUM('Employee Table'[Salary]) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the percentage of employees at each performance rating level? | DAX Measure: COUNTROWS(FILTER('Employee Table', 'Employee Table'[Rating] = "Good")) / COUNTROWS('Employee Table') |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the overall gender pay gap? | DAX Measures: [Average Salary Male] - [Average Salary Female] where each average is a CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Employee Table'[Salary]), 'Employee Table'[Gender] = "Male"). |
| ‚Ä¢ How does the gender pay gap vary by department? | DAX Measure: Use AVERAGE salary measure with 'Department' and 'Gender' on axes. Can create a calculated column for Gender Pay Gap within a department. |
| ‚Ä¢ How does the gender pay gap vary by region? | DAX Measure: Similar to departmental pay gap, but using 'Location' instead of 'Department'. |
| ‚Ä¢ How many employees are paid below the new minimum wage of ‚Çπ90,000? | DAX Measure: COUNTROWS(FILTER('Employee Table', 'Employee Table'[Salary] < 90000)) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the distribution of salaries across predefined bands (e.g., ‚Çπ20,000-‚Çπ29,999, etc.)? | DAX Calculated Column: Create a 'Salary Band' column using nested IF statements based on Salary. Then use this column in visuals. |
| ‚Ä¢ How do the salary distributions by bands differ across regions? | DAX Visual: Use 'Salary Band' and 'Location' on axes, with 'Count of Employees' as values. |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the individual bonus amount for each employee? | DAX Calculated Column: Merge 'Employee Table' with 'Bonus Rules Table' on 'Rating' and 'Department'. Then Salary * Related('Bonus Rules Table'[Bonus_Percentage]). Handle unmapped ratings (e.g., 'Not Rated') by setting bonus to 0. |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the total pay (salary + bonus) for each employee? | DAX Calculated Column: 'Employee Table'[Salary] + 'Employee Table'[Bonus_Amount] |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the total bonus amount to be paid out per region? | DAX Measure: CALCULATE(SUM('Employee Table'[Bonus_Amount]), ALLEXCEPT('Employee Table', 'Employee Table'[Location])) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the total salary (inclusive of bonus) to be paid out per region? | DAX Measure: CALCULATE(SUM('Employee Table'[Total_Pay]), ALLEXCEPT('Employee Table', 'Employee Table'[Location])) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the grand total bonus amount for the entire company? | DAX Measure: SUM('Employee Table'[Bonus_Amount]) |
| ‚Ä¢ What is the grand total salary (inclusive of bonus) for the entire company? | DAX Measure: SUM('Employee Table'[Total_Pay]) |

üìà Key Business Discoveries & Impact
My analysis yielded several significant insights, offering valuable perspectives for Palmoria Group's HR strategies:
 * Gender Distribution Insights: The organization shows a relatively balanced gender distribution overall, though distinct variations are observable at the regional and departmental levels.
 * Performance Rating Trends: "Good" emerged as the most common performance rating across all genders, but notable differences exist in the distribution of "Poor," "Good," and "Very Good" ratings between male and female employees. No "Excellent" ratings were found in the dataset.
 * Addressing the Gender Pay Gap: A pervasive male-favored pay gap was identified across the entire organization, evident in all regions and most departments. Specific departments like Business Development, Human Resources, and Product Management showed significant disparities, warranting targeted intervention by management to promote equitable compensation.
 * Minimum Wage Non-Compliance: A critical finding revealed that a substantial portion of employees (69.13%) are paid below the new minimum wage of $$90,000$. This highlights an urgent need for salary adjustments to comply with regulations and ensure fair compensation across all departments and regions.
 * Comprehensive Compensation Planning: The integrated analysis of salary, performance ratings, and bonus rules allowed for precise calculation of individual and total bonus payouts, providing a clear financial projection for compensation planning at both regional and company-wide levels.
